# alkemy fullstack challenge
An application to carry the personal budget: income and expenses. With user accounts and API.


________________________________________________________________________________________


Hello! 
I developed this application for the alkemy challenge, for full-stack developers.

The front-end is developed based on reactJS.
I used bootstrap and mui for styling and some functionality, as well as fontawesome and sweetalert2.

For the back-end, I created an API in nodeJS, with express, and mySQL database with the prisma plugin.

I think that using prisma was perhaps not a good choice, in case you wanted to see how I built the queries directly with SQL. But, I thought about it already when I was finishing. So I leave in comments the SQL queries that I would have done for each case.

For the management of user accounts and API security I used firebase authentication.
